# CookMe
Project for creating iOS app in Telerik Academy 2016.

### Overview
With this app you can enter the ingredients you have in you home and search for suitable meals to cook with these available ingredients. The app will list meals that you can then add to your favorite meals and also add notes and photos of the already cooked meals. The app is intended to act both as convenient "what to cook" tool and a shopping list at the same time as some meals will require ingredients that are not available in your fridge.

### Features
- Add / Remove ingredients in a list;
- Suggest meals based on the available ingredients (create combinations of the available ingredients and search for meals based on different combination at a time);
- Meals can be added to Favorites list;
- Upload photos of cooked meals;
- Add notes to the saved recipies (your personal know-how for the preparation of the recipie);
